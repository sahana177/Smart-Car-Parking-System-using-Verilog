Smart-Car-Parking-System-using-Verilog
A Smart Car Parking System is something which has not been implemented in many areas. At most places watchmen have been assigned for the smooth functioning of vehicles in the parking area. However, lots of unskilled labor is used up in this. But this is a system which has been realized in many of the developed countries and so this was the basic reason for motivation of undertaking this Project. The System might seem complex to operate, but it is extremely simple to model such a system using Finite State Machines (FSM). This system will have a variety of applications in a multitude of places, and the most important part is that the concept of this system can be extended beyond a car, to say, to allow people to pass through a line in a Cinema hall or a Mall. Thus, in this project, a Verilog Code and a testbench was written for Smart Car Parking System Model.
